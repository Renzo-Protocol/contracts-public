# Renzo Protocol

The Renzo Protocol is a layer over top of EigenLayer (EL) that allows a community to pool their staked tokens together and earn rewards. The community can determine which EL operators to delegate to and what percentage to each.

Additionally the protocol can determine which ERC20 collateral tokens that can be deposited to secure Actively Validated Services (AVS) on EL.

Ownership of the protocol is determined by the amount of ezETH you hold. ezETH is minted when you deposit collateral into the protocol and burned when you withdraw.

When AVSs pay out rewards to restakers, the value will accrue in the protocol.
