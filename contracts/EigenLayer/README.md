# Note

This is the M2 (second mainnet release) of the EigenLayer contracts.

This is copied from the EL repo for convenience from master at the initial build phase.
Once this repo is tagged with a final release or a public NPM package is published, those versions should be used instead.
Another possibility is to use a git submodule
